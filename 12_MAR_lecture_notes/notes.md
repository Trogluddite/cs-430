# keylogger project
 - we'll log, but we want to look for things that match password rules
 - time is optional -- works better that way, but not required 
   - keep track of time between keystrokes
 - we'll want something like a queue (but probably don't need it ... just read the ends of a buffer)
 - rb tree demo & kbd.c demo are good ways to get started
 - due right after spring break
