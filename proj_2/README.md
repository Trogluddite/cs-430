# Compiled w/ Kernel v. 6.7.6 
  - tty_driver doesn't  have a 'magic' member anymore
  - not sure if input validation was needed but I added it, and kept a 'read' method to show current status
  - I included some screenshots of usage
    - Just schlubing in a VM, so I included a shot of the lights lit on the virtual keyboard
