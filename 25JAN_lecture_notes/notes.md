templates are used a lot of generic programming or if you don't want to try to coerce the compiler into inlining things

in our example with GCC on x86 running the optimizer without inline, the function isn't inlined;
without optimizer, inline doesn't inline
combining both eventually gets it there


Project 1 notes

look at tester.h for a bundle_struct

put solution into solution.c
should have a simiple makefile

CLang doesn't like the cflags from the makefile?? maybe use GCC, maybe explore flag

w3m? What is? better than Lynx?
